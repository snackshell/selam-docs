# Best Practices

To get the most out of the SelamAPI platform, we recommend following these best practices for model selection, performance, and security.

## Model Selection
- **Selam-Coder**: Use for programming tasks, code review, and technical documentation.
- **Selam-Thinking**: Use for analysis, research, and complex reasoning tasks.
- **Selam-Plus**: Use for creative writing, general assistance, and content creation.
- **Selam-Turbo**: Use for real-time applications and quick responses where speed is critical.

## Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate `max_tokens` limits to control the length and cost of your responses.
- Adjust `temperature` based on your use case. Use lower values (e.g., 0.1-0.3) for factual, deterministic tasks, and higher values (e.g., 0.7-0.9) for creative tasks.
- Implement streaming for long responses to improve the user experience.
- Consider caching frequently requested, non-user-specific responses on your end to reduce latency and API calls.

## Security Guidelines
- **Store API keys securely.** Never expose them in client-side code. Use environment variables or a secret management service.
- **Implement rate limiting on your client or application side** to prevent abuse and control costs.
- **Validate and sanitize all user inputs** before sending them to the API to prevent prompt injection and other vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor API usage regularly.** Set up alerts for unusual activity or unexpected spikes in usage.
