# Function Calling

Function calling allows you to describe functions to the model, and have the model intelligently output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a powerful way to connect the model's capabilities with external tools and APIs.

## Usage

To use function calling, you provide a list of tools (functions) in your API request. If the model determines that a function should be called, it will respond with a `tool_calls` object containing the function name and arguments.

Here is an example of how to use function calling to get weather information:

```python copy
# Function calling example
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-selam-your-api-key-here",
    base_url="https://api.selamapi.com/v1"
)

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                    },
                    "unit": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="selam-plus",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston?"}
    ],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

Your application code is then responsible for executing the function with the provided arguments and sending the result back to the model to continue the conversation.
