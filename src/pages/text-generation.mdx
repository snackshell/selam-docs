# Text Generation

Text generation is one of the core features of the SelamAPI platform. You can use it for a wide variety of tasks, including content creation, summarization, translation, and more.

## Basic Usage

To generate text, you send a request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with a model and a list of messages. The messages should be in the format of a conversation, with roles for `system`, `user`, and `assistant`.

Here is a basic example using cURL:

```bash copy
curl -X POST "https://api.selamapi.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-selam-your-api-key-here" \
  -d '{
    "model": "selam-plus",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a creative writing assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a short story about an AI that discovers creativity."
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 1500,
    "temperature": 0.8
  }'
```

## Streaming Responses

For a better user experience in real-time applications, you can stream responses. This allows you to receive the generated text token by token, instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated.

To enable streaming, set the `stream` parameter to `true` in your request. See the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide for a Python streaming example.
