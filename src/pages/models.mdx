```javascript copy
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-selam-your-api-key-here',
  baseURL: 'https://api.selamapi.com/v1'
});

async function analyzeData() {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'selam-thinking', // Specify the model here
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'You are an expert data analyst.'
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'Analyze the pros and cons of microservices.'
      }
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

analyzeData();
```
