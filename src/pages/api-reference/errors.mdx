# Errors

SelamAPI uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with SelamAPI's servers (these are rare).

## Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Meaning | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | Bad Request | Your request was malformed or missing a required parameter. |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Your API key is wrong, missing, or invalid. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | You have hit your rate limit. Please wait before making a new request. |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | We had a problem with our server. Try again later. |
| `503` | Service Unavailable | We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later. |

## Error Handling Example

It's important to handle errors gracefully in your application. Here is a Python example demonstrating how to catch and inspect exceptions from the API.

```python copy
from openai import OpenAI, APIError

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-selam-your-api-key-here",
    base_url="https://api.selamapi.com/v1"
)

try:
    # Intentionally use a wrong model name to trigger an error
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="selam-non-existent-model",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
    )
except APIError as e:
    print(f"An API error occurred: {e}")
    print(f"Status code: {e.status_code}")
    print(f"Error type: {e.type}")
    print(f"Error message: {e.message}")
```
