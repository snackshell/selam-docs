# Endpoints

The SelamAPI is structured around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL
All API requests should be made to the following base URL:
```
https://api.selamapi.com
```

## OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints
We provide full compatibility with the OpenAI API, allowing you to use their official SDKs.

### Chat
Create a model response for the given chat conversation.
`POST /v1/chat/completions`

### Models
Lists the currently available models, and provides basic information about each one.
`GET /v1/models`

### Embeddings
Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms.
`POST /v1/embeddings`

### Completions (Legacy)
Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions. This is a legacy endpoint and we recommend using the Chat endpoint for new applications.
`POST /v1/completions`
