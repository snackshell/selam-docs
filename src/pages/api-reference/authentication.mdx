# Authentication

All API requests to SelamAPI must be authenticated using an API key.

## API Key Format

SelamAPI uses secure API keys with the following format:
`sk-selam-[64-character-hex-string]`

## Getting an API Key
1. Sign up at [selamapi.com](https://selamapi.com) (this is a placeholder link).
2. Navigate to your user dashboard.
3. Click "Create API Key".
4. Copy your key and store it securely. Do not share it publicly.

## Using API Keys

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request, using the `Bearer` token type.

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk-selam-your-api-key-here
```

Here is an example with `curl`:
```bash copy
curl https://api.selamapi.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-selam-your-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "selam-plus",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
