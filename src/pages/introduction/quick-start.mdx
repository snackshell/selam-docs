# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with the SelamAPI. In just a few minutes, you'll be able to make your first API call.

## 1. Get your API Key

To use the SelamAPI, you first need an API key. You can get one by signing up on our platform and generating a new key from your dashboard.

## 2. Install the SDK

We recommend using the official OpenAI Python or Node.js libraries, as SelamAPI is fully compatible with them.

```bash copy
npm install openai
```

## 3. Make your first API call

Now you can use your API key to make a request. Here's a simple example using the Python SDK to generate a chat completion.

```python copy
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the SelamAPI client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-selam-your-api-key-here",
    base_url="https://api.selamapi.com/v1"
)

# Create a chat completion
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="selam-plus",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

That's it! You've successfully made your first API call to SelamAPI. You can now explore the other models and features available in our platform.
